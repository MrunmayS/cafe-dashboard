You are working in a Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind project.

**Goal:**  
Build a frontend analytics dashboard that showcases key metrics from the Café Rewards dataset. All the data is already stored in a Supabase (Postgres) database and accessible via a Supabase MCP endpoint.

**You have:**  
- A running Next.js app (basic setup complete)  
- TailwindCSS already configured  
- Access to Supabase via MCP (SQL execution through an API)  
- A Figma file that serves as the design reference (read-only access via Figma MCP)  
- Optionally, context7 for live documentation (https://docs.my-library.io)

**Database Tables:**  
- `offers`: details of promotional offers (bogo, discount, informational)  
- `customers`: demographics like gender, income, signup date  
- `events`: logs of offer received/viewed/completed + transactions

**What you want to build:**  
A dashboard that shows these metrics:
1. **KPIs**: overall completion rate, completion by offer type, % users who completed ≥1 offer, avg days to complete  
2. **Trends**: daily transactions, weekly completion rate, stacked bar of offer types over time  
3. **Demographics**: gender breakdown of completions, income vs. completion rate, channel effectiveness  
4. **Summaries**: total transactions, % BOGO offers completed, 7-day rolling avg spend

**Your job:**  
- Use the Supabase MCP to run SQL queries and fetch metrics  
- Render all metrics as cards/charts using React + Tailwind  
- Use Figma MCP to inspect layout tokens or design spacing if needed  
- Do not attempt to write to Figma—read-only reference only  
- Return a complete, functional dashboard at `/` when someone runs `npm run dev`

Only fetch, transform, and render data visually using components—this is a read-only analytics frontend based on live database values.
